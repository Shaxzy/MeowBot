# MeowBot - Not finished, stop asking for files
Fully automated internal walkbot for CS:GO.

The primary goal is to make an internal cheat that automatically queues deathmatch, walks around the map and kills enemies ~~in order to boost nonprime accounts to private rank 21~~ Since it's no longer possible to get to prime by just playing, this can still be used to farm service medals. This is done by taking advantage of nav meshes.
