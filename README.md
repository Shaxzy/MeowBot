# MeowBot - Not finished, stop asking for files
Fully automated internal walkbot for CS:GO.

The primary goal is to make an internal cheat that automatically queues deathmatch, walks around the map and kills enemies in order to boost nonprime accounts to private rank 21. This is done by taking advantage of nav meshes.

Since it's no longer possible to get to prime by just playing, this can still be used to farm service medals.
